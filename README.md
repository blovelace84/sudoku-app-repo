For my project I created my first Sudoku game. This game is design with only Svelte as my frontend technology. This is my first time using Svelte and I had fun working with this technology. The game is design as simple as it can be with a game board and some numbers generated. There are also some buttons to where you choose to click one of them, like the new game button and generates a new set of numbers. I had fun making this app with Svelte and I can't wait to share this with everyone.
